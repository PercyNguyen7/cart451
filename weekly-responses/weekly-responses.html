            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white align-center">I could be silly, serious or anywhere in between.</p>
            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-yellow ">I felt in love with web development thanks to its versatility. Games design, story telling, education, you name it! It can be made for any purpose which appears scary yet proves exhilirating! Its scary, wild and unexpected. Although I am new to this practice, I am determined to make bizarre projects that question societal issues. </p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white"> <a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/saintbrieuc" class="text-yellow">Exhausting A Crowd</a>  is a crowdsourced art work by Kyle McDonald that explores ethical concerns over public surveillance. Users on the website may make annotations on a 12 hours pre recorded footage by the England CCTV. The project took inspiration by An Attempt at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7902560-an-attempt-at-exhausting-a-place-in-paris" class="text-yellow">An Attempt At Exhausting A Place in Paris</a>, a literature piece by Goerge Perec on his vigilant observation of daily life in Saint-Sulpice Square, Paris. His scrutiny of the public not only mirrors the camera’s watch, it adds a layer of humane feedback to the observation.      </p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white">
                In <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/06/crowds/" class="text-yellow">"The Rise of Crowdsourcing"</a> article, Jeff Howe paints the drawbacks of crowdsourcing in commercial use, Exhausting A Crowd cleverly utilizes crowdsourcing as an artistic critique on public surveillance by allowing web users to actively participate in the issue. The project’s ingenious strategy to encourage users to examine and prod public subjects does make one wonder what if one is the surveilled subject. The 2015 art work is increasingly relevant in the modern day with the growing numbers of electronic devices and technological development. It effectively unveils the paranoia that follows as the more participants there are, the more alarming it is. It proves that anyone could be behind camera and public footage.
