            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white align-center">I could be silly, serious or anywhere in between.</p>
            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-yellow ">I felt in love with web development thanks to its versatility. Games design, story telling, education, you name it! It can be made for any purpose which appears scary yet proves exhilirating! Its scary, wild and unexpected. Although I am new to this practice, I am determined to make bizarre projects that question societal issues. </p>
            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white align-right">You may now carry on and have a great day!</p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white"> <a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/saintbrieuc" class="text-yellow">Exhausting A Crowd</a>  is a crowdsourced art work by Kyle McDonald that explores ethical concerns over public surveillance. Users on the website may make annotations on a 12 hours pre recorded footage by the England CCTV. The project took inspiration by An Attempt at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7902560-an-attempt-at-exhausting-a-place-in-paris" class="text-yellow">An Attempt At Exhausting A Place in Paris</a>, a literature piece by Goerge Perec on his vigilant observation of daily life in Saint-Sulpice Square, Paris. His scrutiny of the public not only mirrors the camera’s watch, it adds a layer of humane feedback to the observation.      </p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white">
                In <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/06/crowds/" class="text-yellow">"The Rise of Crowdsourcing"</a> article, Jeff Howe paints the drawbacks of crowdsourcing in commercial use, Exhausting A Crowd cleverly utilizes crowdsourcing as an artistic critique on public surveillance by allowing web users to actively participate in the issue. The project’s ingenious strategy to encourage users to examine and prod public subjects does make one wonder what if one is the surveilled subject. The 2015 art work is increasingly relevant in the modern day with the growing numbers of electronic devices and technological development. It effectively unveils the paranoia that follows as the more participants there are, the more alarming it is. It proves that anyone could be behind camera and public footage.

            <h2 class="ff-title fs-500 text-yellow">Reading Response Week 6 - Experiential Data Visualization</h2>
            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white"> <a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/" class="text-yellow"> We Feel Fine</a> records the full sentence that contains  “i feel” from newest blog entries as well as the age, gender and location of the author. It then categorizes the emotion emerging from each input and groups them together using colors. This approach effectively reveals the true emotions of bloggers as they are comfortably expressing themselves in their safe space. The same emotions would likely be omitted had they been collected through a plain survey. By indexing context, users are able to draw common patterns of emotions within a specific time period and see whether worldly events have an impact on the public. Users may also remark on common thematics that evoke an emotional reaction and the appropriate feelings in response.
                It is a shame that most browsers no longer support Java, I may only see the project through its documentation and youtube videos. 
                </p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white">
               Another project that touches on experiential data visualization is <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject" class="text-yellow">Dear Data</a>  by Gorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. Lasting over a year, the two information designers send a postcard containing their hand drawing of personal data. For everyday, a given theme is agreed upon and both authors record their data and visualize it through unique sketches. By visualizing their personal data artistically and sending/receiving them through mailed postcards, this project challenges the contemporary digital approach to data collection.</p>
               
            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white">There are many similarities between the Dear Data and We Feel Fine as they both touch on the participants’ experience and feelings.
                The two projects use both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. While Dear Data demonstrates data through quantitative drawings and artistic interpretation, We Feel Fine amasses a large amount of data about blogger’s qualitative emotions. It is fascinating how one collects data humanely yet displays it through quantity while the other automatedly collects data about humans’ emotions. Their goals are also similar; both utilize data collection to understand humans and our emotions.

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white"> <a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/quantummemories/" class="text-yellow"> Quantum Memories</a> is a data sculpture comissioned by National Gallery of Victoria to Refik Anadol Studio. A dataset of 200 million images of nature is fed into the machine learning algorithms in order for it to create its own fictional image and definition of nature through quantum mechanics. As Quantum Computers are still experimental, this project explores the use of quantum computing for a more positive light. The final project is then projected on a 10m by 10m screen in the gallery.
                </p>

            <p class="ff-para fs-400 text-white">
              This AI artwork is simply mesmerizing. It reminds me of artworks created with colored sand, consisting of god knows how many grain of sand. These tiny particles that I assume to be atoms created by quantum computing is what make this project so incredible. It seems like a never ending wave of ocean with the water reflecting the beautiful nature. Different type of landforms may also be seen (lake, deep ocean, jungle, canyon) which are the remains of the dataset. The decision to include the artwork inside a 3d square box cleverly create the impression of the artwork flowing and raging inside its container, as if nature is not to be held captive by humanity. </p>
